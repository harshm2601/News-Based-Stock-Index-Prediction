## üìä Project Overview

This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to predict stock market movements based on financial news sentiment. By leveraging FinBERT for financial news sentiment analysis and LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting, we achieve improved accuracy in stock price predictions.

The system collects financial news from the New York Times, analyzes its sentiment using FinBERT (a financial domain-specific BERT model), and combines this with historical stock price data to predict future market trends.

## üéØ Features

- **Financial News Collection**: Automated retrieval of relevant news from the New York Times API
- **Stock Data Acquisition**: Historical stock price data collection from Yahoo Finance
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced financial sentiment scoring using FinBERT
- **Multiple Predictive Models**:
  - Standard MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network
  - Enhanced FinBERT-LSTM model integrating sentiment features
- **Performance Comparison**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to compare model performance

## üìà Results

Our comparative analysis demonstrates that the FinBERT-LSTM model outperforms traditional models:

| Model | MAE | MAPE | Accuracy |
|-------|-----|------|----------|
| MLP | 218.33 | 0.0177 | 98.23% |
| LSTM | 180.58 | 0.0146 | 98.54% |
| FinBERT-LSTM | 153.72 | 0.0121 | 98.79% |

This shows the value of incorporating financial news sentiment into stock market prediction models.
